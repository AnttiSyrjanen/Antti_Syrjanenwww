                    Team Seattle is an endurance auto racing team and charitable organization founded by racing driver Don Kitch, Jr. in 1997 to raise funds for the Seattle Children's Hospital. Team Seattle's drivers and other supporting teams who compete in the 24 Hours of Daytona gain pledges from donors based on the number of laps their cars can complete over the event. Since first entering Daytona in 1997, Team Seattle has raised over $3.3 million for Seattle Children's. A new endeavor for 2009 will have Team Seattle participate in another endurance event, the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France, and also raise funds for the Mecenat Chirurgie Cardiaque Enfants du Monde. The team's driving squad will include American actor Patrick Dempsey.
